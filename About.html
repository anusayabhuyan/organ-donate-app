    <h3>Information about Organ, Eye, and Tissue Donation</h3>

<h4>HOW DONATION WORKS</h4>
<p>More than 155 million people have registered as organ donors, but only about 3 in 1,000 can actually become donors when they die. Learn about the process of becoming a deceased organ donor.

    The Living Donation Process
    While most organ and tissue donations occur after the donor has died, some organs (including a kidney or part of a liver or lung) and tissues can be donated while the donor is alive. There are about as many living donors every year as there are deceased donors.
